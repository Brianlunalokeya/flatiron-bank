# flatiron-bank
flatiron-bank react app
This project is a React application that displays a list of recent bank transactions, and allows users to add new transactions, filter transactions by description, and optionally sort transactions by category or description.

Requirements This project fetches data from a local server running JSON DB server, which should be set up with a db.json file using the data provided. The project requires a well-written README file. Project Setup To set up the project, follow these steps:

Core Deliverables As a user, you should be able to:

See a table of transactions.
Fill out and submit the form to add a new transaction. This should add the new transaction to the table as well as post the new transaction to the backend API for persistence.
Filter transactions by typing into the search bar. Only transactions with a description matching the search term should be shown in the transactions table.
Advanced Deliverables As a user, you should be able to:

Sort transactions alphabetically by category or description.
Delete a transaction which will remove it from the table and delete it from the backend.
